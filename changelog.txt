Text2tab changelog
==================

Legend
------
* : fixed
! : changed
+ : added
- : removed

v2.3.5, 2023-07-??
------------------
* code and type cleanups
+ possibility to keep fields_only order during serialization #25
+ auto detection of description line with spaces

v2.3.4, 2021-10-10
------------------
+ new feature: serialize as html. The key usage is to copy the result into excel, it allows marking certain fields as text, to avoid autoconversion. E.g. "1.1" will not convert to date

v2.3.3, 2021-10-10
------------------
+ new feature: method serialize_header to output just header technames or description. IMPORTANT: this will probably replace "i_add_header_descr" param in CREATE.
+ new experimental bind_data and bind_fields_only methods, to make more convenient chaining and several calls to serialize and serialize_header
+ added simple benchmark program

v2.3.2, 2019-11-02
------------------
* bug fix with parse_float
! parse_float does not parse native format first (123.23 fails if number format declares another decimal separator)
* better field name validation (thanks to @Huargh)
+ new feature: support for "corresponding" parsing

v2.3.1, 2019-09-27
------------------
+ support for time type parsing, thanks to @germanysources

v2.3.0, 2019-08-22
------------------
+ support for deep parsing - structure and table fields, referencing an additional data source. Major feature - see readme.
* moved some parser methods to utils

v2.2.5, 2019-08-22
------------------
+ ignore non-flat fields option e.g. technical fields like alv colorcol
* get back lost error information attributes: line, field, structure
* reuse standard abap types

v2.2.4, 2019-01-25
------------------
! `version` constant moved to zif_text2tab_constants
! utils=>check_version_fits - used internally, but also can be used to check 2 versions in vX.X.X format

v2.2.3, 2018-11-26
------------------
! serialization performance improved ~2x on large data sets (150k lines in test)

v2.2.2, 2018-11-26
------------------
! bug fix for data types in exception
+ added an example of DB table backup with serializer - ztext2tab_backup_example

v2.2.1, 2018-11-21
------------------
! source moved to src subfolder
+ string based renames (see readme)

v2.2.0, 2018-11-09
------------------
+ comment lines

v2.1.0, 2018-11-08
------------------
+ field name mapping feature (rename fields on-the-fly)
! more generic data types (thanks to @odjhey)
! field name charset validation
! fixed date serialization (empty date translated to "  .  .    ")
! improved conv_exit error handling

v2.0.0-beta, 2018-09-02
------------------
! moved the code to global classes for easier reuse, renamed to text2tab_parser (from data_parser) which should be clearer.
+ support for LF line breaks
+ supports double quotes
+ supports specifying date format
+ supports int1/2, thanks to @germanysources
+ parse_typeless feature. create_typeless would create an instance which does not checks types but rather returns reference to table of records where all the fields are strings
+ support for serializing - zcl_text2tab_serializer

v1.1.1, 2016-08-23
------------------
+ float support added
+ overflow checks added
+ fine tuning

v1.1.0, 2016-08-21
