# Installation

You can install the whole code using [abapGit](https://github.com/abapGit/abapGit).

The tool is open source and distributed under MIT license. It was initially created as a part of another project - [mockup loader](https://github.com/sbcgua/mockup_loader) - but then separated as an independent multi-usage tool.

The package contains 2 subpackages: `core` (the tool itself) and `examples` (example programs). The latter can be skipped for the deserialization (abapGit supports filename filtering - specify `*/examples/*` in the corresponding repo setting).
